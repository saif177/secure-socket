# Secure-Socket.IO

Secure-Socket.IO is a real-time communication framework designed to provide secure and encrypted communication between clients and servers using bidirectional encryption and decryption. It ensures that data transmitted between parties is kept confidential and protected from unauthorized access.

## Features:
- **Bidirectional Encryption & Decryption:** Ensures both sender and receiver are encrypting and decrypting messages with unique encryption keys.
- **Real-time Communication:** Enables secure socket communication in real time for applications such as chat apps, live data transmission, etc.
- **Encryption Algorithms:** Uses industry-standard encryption methods to secure data (AES, RSA, etc.).
- **Easy to Integrate:** Simple API for integrating into any existing socket-based communication system.

## Installation:
